# Web Assassin == Alpine.js Boilerplate Starter Template
Webpack based boilerplate starter template including Alpine.js and Sass/Scss compilation.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repo
2. `npm i`
3. `npm run dev`

## Customize

### Change the namespace
In `src/index.js` you'll see </br>
```javascript
const namespace = 'webassassin'
```
This is there to avoid collisions with other libraries. Change it to something uniquely yours if you prefer.
